                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>
                        Doctor Steel (full name, Doctor Phineas Waldolf Steel) was a self-published American musician and internet personality from Los Angeles. He performed on rare occasions with a “backup band”, claiming that a fictitious robot band had malfunctioned. Shows incorporated puppetry, multimedia and performances by female members (“Nurses” and “Scouts”) of his street team, The Army of Toy Soldiers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On stage, and in all public performances and interviews, Steel maintained the appearance of a mad scientist bent on conquering the world and becoming the future World Emperor. He claimed to be a former toymaker who, in a fit of rage over being fired for creating drastic designs such as babies with buzzsaws for hands, burned down the factory he worked at and was committed to a psychiatric institution. This back-story relates that Steel escaped the sanitarium and retreated to a deserted island laboratory, where he became bent on world conquest in order to create a “Utopian Playland” where his toy designs could be enjoyed.As a mad scientist, Steel is obsessed with conspiracy theories, giant robots, baking cupcakes and “mind control cookies”, and experimenting with hamsters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In appearance, Steel drew on the mad scientist archetype, dressing in a white PVC lab coat (with comically large black buttons), black PVC gloves, black boots, shaved head, sinister goatee, and antique welder’s goggles. When not in his “mad scientist” costume, Steel typically dressed in a very aristocratic neo-Victorian steampunk style, while still retaining his goggles. He was never seen without the goggles.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Retirement</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2010, Dr. Steel announced plans to begin work on a new album, entitled "Toymonger." However, in July 2011, after a long period of silence, it was announced that Doctor Steel had retired from the music industry, and a personal letter from Steel to the current head of the Army of Toy Soldiers in January 2012 confirmed this. The Army of Toy Soldiers have decided to continue on as an organization, switching their focus from promoting the entertainer to promoting the philosophy he presented, such as the importance of creativity and building one's own Utopian Playland.
